My name is Addy â€“ a young NYU engineer We BOTH know that you are such an important, yet busy figure at WarnerMedia, but if you found a 20-minute time slot, I absolutely appreciate chatting with you about who you are and your come-up story, since I graduate in 2022 (woo hoo!) and hope to work with you on the Warner team! Thank you and best wishes, Addy'
